# R2D2
Code for a R2D2 bot controlled and ran by an Arduino Mega 2560

Everything in the "test" branch, is that which can be used to test 
different components of the bot and how well they do or do not work 
together.

Everything in the, "bot" branch, is the final code. The html files 
and template folder need to be placed in the /var/www/html/ folder 
on your Raspberry Pi.

For instrunctions on how to use said code and build said bot,
