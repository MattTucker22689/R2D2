# R2D2
Code for a R2D2 bot ran by an Arduino Mega 2560, controlled via a web interface operating on a Raspberry Pi.

Everything in the "Test" branch, is that which can be used to test 
different components of the bot and how well they do or do not work 
together.

Everything in the, "WebPyTest" branch, is the final code.

For instrunctions on how to use said code and build said bot, 
please see:
            INSTRUCTABLE LINK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
            
Please keep in mind, this is an active project; and as such, the code is likely to be buggy at times.

Feel free to contact me if you have any problems or suggestions.

Thanks,
-Matt
